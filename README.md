# KubernetesSheet

Masternode hostet Kubernetes Control Plane, dar체ber wird das gesamte Kubernetes System gemangaged, enth채lt folgende Komponenten  
- hat Kubernetes Api Server (gegen den man Befehle ausf체hrt)
- Scheduler (h채ndelt Workernodes)
- Controller Manager (clustern, replicating components, keeping tracks of nodes ?)
- etcd (Daten speichern)

Workernodes: Dort laufen meine Applications drauf
- Docker 
- kubelet (redet zum API Server vom Masternode)
- kube-proxy (load balancing)
- 1 node kann 1..n pods laufen lassen

Summary aus Kapitel 1:
- Monolithic apps are easier to deploy, but harder to maintain over time and sometimes impossible to scale.
- Microservices-based application architectures allow easier development of each component, but are harder to deploy and configure to work as a single system. Linux containers provide much the same benefits as virtual machines, but are far more lightweight and allow for much better hardware utilization.
- Docker improved on existing Linux container technologies by allowing easier and faster provisioning of containerized apps together with their OS environments. Kubernetes exposes the whole datacenter as a single computational resource for running applications.
- Developers can deploy apps through Kubernetes without assistance from sysadmins.
- Sysadmins can sleep better by having Kubernetes deal with failed nodes auto- matically.
